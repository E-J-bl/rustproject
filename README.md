# Behold Graph Theory 
> My code runs slow so instead of optimising i will write it in a faster language 
- the ethos of this work

---
Part of a larger project related to graph thoery and networking. This algorithm (should) find the total dominating set of a graph which is a useful feature to have for making pathing algorithms run faster.
It is also useful for solving a name space issue. 

It will hopefully be run as a child process and so featurs such as pipes may be implemented so the program can be ran continously in the background performing backend functionality that may be expanded as needed.
This requires programming for specific OSes so this is on hold for now.
Therefore, for now the program will be spawned as a child only when it is needed (killed the second it finishes) and will just read a file from memory.
